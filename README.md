# FRIENDER BENDER

Friender Bender is a local multiplayer sabotage driving game, where up to 4 players take turns controlling 1 car for 15 seconds each, avoiding obstacles and navigating an increasingly crazy course. The player that crashes while driving is eliminated, until only one remains. While not driving, the other players can trigger weapons and distractions aimed at the player who *is* driving, such as dropping objects onto the track, making it harder to drive, and much much more.

Based on an idea from [Cool Games Inc. Episode 26, Sabotage Rally](https://soundcloud.com/coolgamesinc/episode-26-sabotage-rally#t=32:24)

**Expected Release Date:** December 2016
